# Scripts

This folder will contain scripts that make interacting and manually testing contracts in this repo a bliss!


For now here are 2 scripts, that are configured to be used with rinkeby, you can change the addresses 
to deployed instances of the Consumer and the Oracle contract to other networks if you like:
<ul>
<li> requestId.js for requesting a price for a specific Sandbox Land id via the SingleConsumerSample contract
<li> retrieveId.js for retrieving the data that is stored in the SingleConsumerSample contract as a result of a request
</ul>
