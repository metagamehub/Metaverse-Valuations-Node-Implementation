# Scripts

This folder will contain scripts that make interacting and manually testing contracts in this repo a bliss!


For now here are 2 scripts:
<ul>
<li> one for requesting a price for a specific Sandbox Land id via the SingleConsumerSample contract
<li> one retrieving the data that is stored in the SingleConsumerSample contract as a result of a request
</ul>
